    </p>
    <p style="color: yellow">
      Since i can remmeber ive always been into video games and electronics. My
      first game console was a special edition Pikachu version of the Nintendo
      64, 007 was my favorite. the Dreamcast, then the Gamecube came next and it
      was off to the races from there.

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Video Games</li>
      <li>Art</li>
      <li>Photography</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color: yellow">
      As i described in my paragraph above video games were pretty much the
      first things to get me into tech.
      <b
        >I loved getting new games and learning the ins and outs of the game.</b
      >
      Art is another hobbie that has been apart of my life for as long as i can
      remember. when i was younger it was coloring and drawing random things but
      as i got older it morphed into Graffiti. I became passionate about color
      and the way letters complimented each other. It was a passion that holds
      strong until this day.
      <u>My passion Photography came a little later in life.</u> Once i was
      older and was able to begin playing with cameras i found how much i loved
      capturing moments in time.
      <i
        >As time progressed and things got more high tech i fell inlove with
        that aspect as well and its also a hobbie that continues through current
        day.</i
